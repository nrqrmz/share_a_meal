### Henrique, below there is a list of the files that were modified in order to fix the problem with the maps and the interactive javascript behavior. 
### Try to fix them in the same order please.
### Compare the content of your version and mine and make the necessary adjustments:
- app/javascript/application.js
- app/javascript/controllers/index.js
- config/initializers/geocoder.rb
- app/assets/stylesheets/application.scss
- app/javascript/controllers/map_index_controller.js
- app/javascript/controllers/map_show_controller.js
- app/javascript/controllers/index_display_controller.js
- app/views/meals/index.html.erb
- app/views/meals/show.html.erb
### If it still doesn't work, please let me know so I can make the necessary corrections.
